# CV Project Guide for AI Agents

## Project Objective

This is a **LaTeX-based CV/Resume project** for Peet Cremer. The primary goals are:

- **Maintain an up-to-date professional CV** in LaTeX format
- **Automate PDF generation** with high-quality typesetting using LuaTeX
- **Track changes visually** using latexdiff for easy review
- **Ensure reproducible builds** across different environments

## Project Structure

```
├── CV_PeetCremer_en.tex      # Main CV source file
├── my-resume.cls             # Custom LaTeX class for styling
├── Makefile                  # Build automation
├── newpic3.jpg               # Profile picture
└── .cursor/rules/agents.mdc  # Project guidelines (this file)
```

## Make Commands Reference

### Core Build Commands

#### `make` or `make CV`
- **Purpose**: Builds the main CV PDF
- **Output**: `CV_PeetCremer_en.pdf`
- **Process**: Runs LuaLaTeX twice for proper cross-references
- **When to use**: After any content changes to generate updated PDF

#### `make clean`
- **Purpose**: Removes all generated files for fresh build
- **Removes**: `*.pdf`, `*.aux`, `*.log`, `*.out` files
- **When to use**: When experiencing build issues or starting fresh

### Diff Generation Commands

#### `make diff`
- **Purpose**: Creates visual diff PDF showing changes from main branch
- **Output**: `CV_PeetCremer_en_diff.pdf`
- **Process**: 
  1. Extracts original CV from `main` branch
  2. Uses `latexdiff --type=UNDERLINE` to create diff document
  3. Compiles to PDF with visual change indicators
- **When to use**: Before creating PRs to visualize all changes

#### `make clean-diff`
- **Purpose**: Removes diff-related files
- **Removes**: `CV_PeetCremer_en_diff.pdf` and temporary diff files
- **When to use**: To clean up after diff generation

## Pull Request Workflow

### ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Always Include Both PDFs

When creating a Pull Request, you **MUST** include both:

1. **Main CV PDF** (`CV_PeetCremer_en.pdf`) - The updated CV
2. **Diff PDF** (`CV_PeetCremer_en_diff.pdf`) - Visual changes from main branch

### Step-by-Step PR Creation Process

1. **Make your CV content changes** in `CV_PeetCremer_en.tex`

2. **Test the build environment**:
   ```bash
   make clean
   make
   ```

3. **Generate both required PDFs**:
   ```bash
   make diff  # This also ensures main PDF is up-to-date
   ```

4. **Verify both files exist**:
   ```bash
   ls -la *.pdf
   # Should show both CV_PeetCremer_en.pdf and CV_PeetCremer_en_diff.pdf
   ```

5. **Commit all changes including both PDFs**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update CV: [description]
   
   - [list key changes]
   - [additional context]
   
   Files updated:
   - CV_PeetCremer_en.pdf (updated CV)
   - CV_PeetCremer_en_diff.pdf (visual diff)"
   ```

6. **Create PR with descriptive title and body**

### Why Both PDFs Are Required

- **Main PDF**: Shows the final result for immediate review
- **Diff PDF**: Allows reviewer to quickly see what changed without manual comparison
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures build process works correctly
- **Version Control**: Provides clear history of changes over time

## Content Update Guidelines

### When Making CV Changes

- **Test incrementally**: Build and test after each significant change
- **Use semantic commits**: Clearly describe what type of change was made
- **Verify formatting**: Check that LaTeX compilation produces clean output
- **Review diffs**: Always generate and review the diff PDF before submitting

### Common Operations

#### Adding New Position
1. Add new `\job{...}` block in appropriate section
2. Update previous position end dates if needed
3. Test build: `make clean && make`
4. Generate diff: `make diff`

#### Updating Project List
1. Add/remove/modify project entries
2. Keep most relevant and recent projects
3. Ensure consistent formatting
4. Test and generate diff

#### Modifying Styling
1. Changes typically go in `my-resume.cls`
2. Test thoroughly as styling affects entire document
3. Always generate diff to see visual impact

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
- Run `make clean` and try again
- Check LaTeX syntax in `.tex` files
- Ensure all required packages are available

### Diff Generation Issues
- Verify git repository state (committed changes)
- Check that `main` branch exists and has CV file
- Try `make clean-diff && make diff`

### Large Diff Files
- Diff PDFs can be larger due to change markup
- This is normal and expected
- Include in PR anyway for review purposes

## Best Practices for AI Agents

1. **Always test builds** before submitting changes
2. **Generate diffs for all content changes** to visualize impact
3. **Include both PDFs in every PR** - this is non-negotiable
4. **Make incremental changes** and test frequently
5. **Use descriptive commit messages** explaining what changed and why
6. **Clean up temporary files** but preserve the two main PDFs for PR

## Environment Notes

- Uses **LuaHBTeX** (TeX Live 2025) for compilation
- Custom class `my-resume.cls` provides styling
- Profile image `newpic3.jpg` is embedded in CV
- Build process handles font loading and package dependencies automatically
