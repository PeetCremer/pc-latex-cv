\section[\faMusic]{About Me}
\hobbylist{Interests}{I am enthusiastic about AI, tech and science related topics. To follow the recent developments in machine learning, I like to read papers on arXiv and from the ICLR conference and I follow \href{https://towardsdatascience.com/}{towardsdatascience} and the \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/}{/r/MachineLearning} subreddit. To stay on top of new trends in software engineering and science topics, I regularly browse \href{https://news.ycombinator.com/}{Hacker News}.

\hobbylist{Activities}{Sozializing with friends has always been important to me. I am an enthusiastic Pen \& Paper gamemaster since 20 years and often meet with friends to indulge together in this hobby. Keeping myself healthy with a good diet and regular exercise is another priority for me. To achieve this, I like to cook quality food with fresh ingredients, and I go running several times a week. To keep myself in shape and the environment clean, I take my racing bike to reach places whenever possible}
